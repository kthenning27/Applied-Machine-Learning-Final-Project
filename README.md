# Applied-Machine-Learning-Final-Project

#Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze the variables involved in the classification of a census tract as a food desert. Data sets from the U.S. Census Bureau
(American Community Survey) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Economic Research Service) included economic and demographic data and classified food deserts at 
the census tract level. Portions of these datasets were combined and used to train machine learning models to then performe feature analysis to understand which 
features play the largest role in food desert classification.

More information on the specifics of this project can be found in the Project Report File.
